## How to run code
- Run Control class
- Will ask for multiple inputs
- number and noun, the type of number Cardinal or Ordinal, if cardinal epithet or predicate sentence
- The code will try to determine the grammatically correct manner to qualify that noun using that integer

### example of a cardinal/epithet
- Java Control
- 2 
- izinja
- C
- E
Output (izinja ezimbili)

### example of a cardinal/epithet
- Java Control
- 1 
- isihlangu
- O
Output (isihlangu sokuqala)


#### The goal is to remove this various inputs and the main method and the class will just take parameters, during refactorign
